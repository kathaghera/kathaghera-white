### Sushila Arts and Academy

For the past two years we have been collaborating with Sushila Arts Academy for
the annual Children&#39;s Theatre production. This course introduces children
ages 8 to 15 the basics of Theatre and orients them to understand the process
of putting up a play production. The past two productions have been a
musical production thus the children were also attuned with elements of
dance and music.

### Karkhana

For the past few years we have also collaborated with Karkhana for their summer
camp sessions. The students who enroll for these sessions get a taste of
working with Theatre and also get to prepare a short play related to the
theme of the workshop, making it and interdisciplinary workshop for the
children to be a part of.
